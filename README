This git repository aims to give the solutions to all the exercises posed
by the book "A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python" by Hans Petter
Langtangen.

You will find a TODO file in each of the chapter folders. This file will
include the exercises and, if an exercise is finished, a label.

If you disagree with the solution or have ideas for alternate solutions, 
please get in touch on martin@rodvand.net
