This git repository aims to give the solutions to all the exercises posed
by the book "A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python" by Hans Petter
Langtangen.

You will find a TODO file in each of the chapter folders. This file will
include the exercises and a OK label if the solution is included.

If you disagree with the solution or have ideas for alternate solutions, 
please get in touch on martin@rodvand.net.

Why do this?
As a part of my University degree I took the course INF1100 at the University
of Oslo. At that course we used this book and we had weekly assignments from
said book. The assignments did not include all the exercises, and I wanted to
work my way through the book and ALL of its exercises. Why not share it with
the rest of the world? Still, if you do use this book for your course - do the
exercises yourself, and if in trouble have a peak at my solution.

And, Python is AWESOME!
